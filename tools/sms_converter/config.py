# A codec is not enough on its own -- SMS looks the codec up in a table that belongs to the
# CONTAINER's reader, so a stream can be perfectly valid, play everywhere else, and still be
# undecodable on the PS2 because that container's table has no entry for it. Read straight
# out of the SMS sources, not assumed:
#
#   AVI      SMS-v1/src/SMS_Codec.c:33-54 (video FourCCs) and :58-65 (audio wFormatTag).
#            Video is MPEG-4 Part 2 and MS-MPEG4v3 ONLY -- there is no MPEG-1 or MPEG-2
#            FourCC in that table at all, and no AAC in the audio one.
#   MP4/M4A  SMS-v1/src/SMS_ContainerMOV.c:346-356, by MPEG-4 object type id.
#   MPEG-PS  SMS-v1/src/SMS_ContainerMPEG_PS.c:673-718, by stream id.
#
# Used two ways: Advanced Settings will not OFFER a combination that lands outside this, and
# the validator warns if one reaches an output anyway.

# Names are ffmpeg DECODER names as ffprobe reports them (codec_name), which is not always the
# encoder name -- libmp3lame encodes to "mp3", libvorbis to "vorbis".
